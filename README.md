The provided Python script visualizes the Bubble Sort algorithm using matplotlib. It generates a random list of 10 integers between 0 and 100, then sorts them using Bubble Sort while displaying the sorting process as a bar chart.

Key Features:
Generates Data: Uses numpy to create a random list (lst) and an index array (x).
Sorting Logic: Implements Bubble Sort, where adjacent elements are swapped if they are out of order.
Visualization: matplotlib dynamically updates a bar chart (plt.bar(x, lst)) to show sorting progress.
Animation: plt.pause(0.001) adds a brief delay, and plt.clf() clears the figure for the next frame.
Final Display: The sorted list is shown at the end with plt.show().
